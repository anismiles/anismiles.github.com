          <p>Remember that your use of Relcy's Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates
            this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to
            them in the Terms of Use.</p>

          <h4>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h4>

          <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (Personal Information) that
            we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own
            or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users,
            as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our
            Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account
            and profile, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how
            you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but
            only as described below.</p>

          <p>As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under
            the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal
            information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under
            age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may
            have provided us personal information, please contact us at contact@relcy.com</p>

          <h4>Will Relcy ever change this Privacy Policy?</h4>

          <p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to
            time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the www.relcy.com website, by sending
            you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice
            emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern
            your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the
            Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the
            changes.</p>

          <h4>What Information does Relcy Collect?</h4>

          <h5>Information You Provide to Us:</h5>

          <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration
            process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email
            address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for
            Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us [or
            otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or
            information in those accounts (Third Party Account Information) may be transmitted into your account with
            us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy;
            for example if you sign in to connect your LinkedIn account to Relcy, the privacy policies of the services
            apply. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our
            features.</p>

          <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your
            email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about
            your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This
            confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do
            not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by contact@relcy.com</p>

          <h5>Information Collected Automatically</h5>

          <p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs
            from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, cookie information,
            the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you
            requested. Cookies are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your
            browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many
            people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your
            device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
            Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies
            to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t
            responsible for their privacy policies and practices.</p>

          <p>Your browser may offer you a Do Not Track option, that allows you to signal to operators of websites and
            web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such
            operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites; our
            Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time. When we collect the usage information described
            above, we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For
            example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we
            can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>

          <h4>Will Relcy Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h4>

          <p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we
            may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>

          <p>Information that’s no longer personally identifiable. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that
            you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide
            aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in
            what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.
            However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you
            personally, as an individual.</p>

          <p>Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may
            sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or
            jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or
            service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that
            it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third
            party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any
            transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business or
            websites policies.</p>

          <p>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your
            information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a third party hosting
            services provider to host our data. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use
            the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

          <p>Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer
            information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets)
            are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control,
            Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

          <p>Protection of Relcy and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any
            information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of
            Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Relcy, our employees, our users, or
            others.</p>

          <h4>Where is my Personal Information stored?</h4>

          <p>While your Personal Information is in our possession, it will be primarily stored at hosting facilities
            located in the USA. These facilities are either operated by Relcy or our third party providers. By using the
            Service you are consenting to have your Personal Information stored, transferred and processed in the
            USA.</p>

          <h4>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h4>

          <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a
            third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party
            site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting
            and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your
            computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>

          <p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records,
            but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software
            failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

          <h4>What Personal Information can I access?</h4>

          <p>Through your account settings you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information
            you’ve provided to us:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Name and password</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Location</li>
            <li>Social account connect</li>
            <li>Contact book access</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any
            questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at
            contact@relcy.com</p>

          <p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83–1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a
            notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third
            parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.
            If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to:
            contact@relcy.com</p>

          <h4>What choices do I have?</h4>

          <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to
            register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>

          <p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information,
            however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of
            your account by emailing us at contact@relcy.com. Some information may remain in our records after your
            deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating
            your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you
            personally.</p>

          <h4>What if I have questions about this policy?</h4>

          <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to
            contact@relcy.com and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>

        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS;
            IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.</p>

          <p>Effective date: 17th of April 2014</p>

          <p>Welcome to Relcy! Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our
            website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or
            concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at contact@relcy.com.</p>

          <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Relcy, Inc. (“Relcy,” “we” and
            “us”). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your
            using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in
            effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in
            the Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h4>Will these Terms ever change?</h4>

          <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the
            Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your
            attention by placing a notice on the www.relcy.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other
            means.</p>

          <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no
            longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is
            effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>

          <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be
            effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>

          <h4>What about my privacy?</h4>

          <p>Relcy takes the privacy of its users very seriously.</p>

          <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain
            parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who
            are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under
            13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal
            information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13,
            we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have
            provided us personal information, please contact us at contact@relcy.com.</p>

          <h4>What are the basics of using Relcy?</h4>

          <p>You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“Relcy User ID”). You
            promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may
            not select as your Relcy User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with
            the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior
            written permission.</p>

          <p>You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received
            your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to
            these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you
            represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s
            behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms,
            except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).</p>

          <p>You will only use the Services for your own use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third
            party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is
            prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be
            responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p>

          <p>You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account
            and your password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p>

          <p>Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:</p>

          <p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content (as defined below) or otherwise
            use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:</p>

          <p>(a) Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including
            Relcy);</p>

          <p>(b) Violates any law or regulation;</p>

          <p>(c) Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise
            objectionable;</p>

          <p>(d) Jeopardizes the security of your Relcy account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log
            in to the Services as you);</p>

          <p>(e) Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other
            user;</p>

          <p>(f) Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption
            codes;</p>

          <p>(g) Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that
            run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper
            working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);</p>

          <p>(h) “Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content
            (through use of manual or automated means);</p>

          <p>(i) Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;</p>

          <p>(j) Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or
            information of or relating to the Services.</p>

          <p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the
            Services.</p>

          <h4>What are my rights in Relcy?</h4>

          <p>The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited
            to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the
            “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all
            copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access
            through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit,
            distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not
            owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates
            someone else’s (including Relcy’s) rights.</p>

          <p>You understand that Relcy owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the
            transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based
            on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>

          <p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this
            functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!

          <p>

          <p>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</p>

          <p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole
            responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and
            content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or
            for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take
            any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of
            having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or
            not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you
            interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>

          <p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and
            warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all
            your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection
            with the Services.</p>

          <p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or
            controlled by Relcy. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there
            are risks in doing so, and that Relcy is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when
            you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website
            or service that you visit or utilize.

          <p>

          <p>Relcy has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or
            practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with
            through the Services. In addition, Relcy will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of
            any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all
            liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.</p>

          <p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment
            and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated
            with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make
            whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline
            transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Relcy shall not be responsible or liable for any
            loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>

          <p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree
            that Relcy is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more
            other users, you release Relcy, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and
            damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed,
            arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident,
            you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not
            extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
            executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement
            with the debtor.”</p>

          <h4>Will Relcy ever change the Services?</h4>

          <p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue
            any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict
            access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the
            Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right
            to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if
            someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and
            without notice.</p>

          <h4>Does Relcy cost anything?</h4>

          <p>The Relcy Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in
            the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish
            to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p>

          <h4>What if I want to stop using Relcy?</h4>

          <p>You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at contact@relcy.com; please refer to our Privacy
            Policy to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our
            Services.</p>

          <p>Relcy is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any
            reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Relcy has the sole right to decide whether
            you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>

          <p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in
            mind before you decide to terminate your account.</p>

          <p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at contact@relcy.com – we will try to
            help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.</p>

          <p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By
            way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or
            indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property
            rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>

          <h4>I use the Relcy App available via the Apple App Store – should I know anything about that?</h4>

          <p>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including the iPhone, iPad, iPhone Touch, and Android
            applications available via the Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) App Store (the “Application”), but the following
            additional terms also apply to the Application:</p>

          <p>(a) Both you and Relcy acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and Relcy only, and not with
            Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the Application or the Content;</p>

          <p>(b) The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable
            basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use,
            subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;</p>

          <p>(c) You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;</p>

          <p>(d) You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and
            support services with respect to the Application;</p>

          <p>(e) In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those
            implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to
            you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;</p>

          <p>(f) You acknowledge and agree that Relcy, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or
            any third party may have in relation to the Application;</p>

          <p>(g) You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the Application or your
            possession and use of the Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Relcy, and
            not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such
            infringement claim;</p>

          <p>(h) You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo,
            or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not
            listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;</p>

          <p>(i) Both you and Relcy acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any
            applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and</p>

          <p>(j) Both you and Relcy acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party
            beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and
            will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary
            hereof.</p>

          <h4>What else do I need to know?</h4>

          <p>Warranty Disclaimer. Relcy does not make any representations or warranties concerning any content contained
            in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright
            compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services. We make no
            representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or
            purchased through the Services. THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
            WARRANTIES OR ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
            MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE
            UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO
            THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

          <p>Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER
            NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL RELCY
            BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
            OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR
            COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100
            OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO RELCY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD
            PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (III) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW
            THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO
            YOU.</p>

          <p>Indemnity. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold Relcy, its
            affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims,
            liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising
            from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any
            actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.</p>

          <p>Assignment. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder,
            or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Relcy’s prior written
            consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without
            consent.</p>

          <p>Choice of Law; Arbitration. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State
            of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or
            relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in [San Francisco County,
            California], in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial
            Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with
            substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be
            selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the
            award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other
            equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement,
            the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in,
            respectively, [San Francisco County, California], or the [Northern District of California]. Any arbitration
            under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not
            permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND RELCY ARE EACH WAIVING THE
            RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

          <p>Miscellaneous. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties,
            and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided
            that the Relcy may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees
            fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver
            of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
            that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall
            otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Relcy agree that these Terms are the
            complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Relcy, and that it supersedes
            and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to
            the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by
            both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an
            employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Relcy, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind
            Relcy in any respect whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the Apple
            Application, you and Relcy agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>
