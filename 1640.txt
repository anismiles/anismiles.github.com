RE: Richard Sullivan
DOB: 02/27/1943

Dear Dr. Cohen,

Thank you for referring your patient whgl saw on 10/15 for evaluation of worsening right rapt. j
sinusitis.

His allergic evaluation did not reveal significant reactions to common inhalants by the prick
method. Spirometry revealed COPD with some reversibility and a truncated inspiratory loop.

My impression is this is a delightful gentleman with worsening rhinosinusitis this past year who
is overweight with GERD, probable sleep disordered breathing, fatigue, COPD with reversibility,
vocal cord dysfunction and hypertension treated with an ACE inhibitor.

| therefore recommended improved environmental control. Prednisone 20 mg b.i.d. for 3 days
followed by trials of Symbicort 160 and Dulera 200 two puffs b.i.d. Antireflux precautions with
Zantac 75 b.i.d. Diaphragmatic breathing. Amoxil 875 b.i.d. for purulent rhinosinusitis.. Trial of
Claritin as needed. Return in 1 month.

Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient with his challenging
problems. If you have any questions, please call.

Sincerely yours,

bul

Paul A. Shapero, MD
